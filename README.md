# 🐍 Snake and Ladder Game: Pygame

Welcome to the **Snake and Ladder Game**, an exciting implementation of the classic board game using the **Pygame** library. This game brings the fun of the traditional Snake and Ladder game to your computer, providing an engaging and interactive experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Snake and Ladder Game** is a simple, two-player board game where each player takes turns to roll a dice and move across the board. The goal is to reach the top square (usually 100) by either climbing ladders or avoiding snakes. This implementation uses **Pygame** to render the game interface and manage user inputs, making it a fun and interactive project.

### Key Features:

- **Two Players**: Play with a friend or challenge yourself with alternating turns.
- **Ladders**: Climb up to a higher position on the board if you land on a ladder.
- **Snakes**: Slide down to a lower position if you land on a snake.
- **Dice Rolling**: Roll a virtual dice to determine how many steps you will move.
- **Graphical Interface**: Visual representation of the board and players using Pygame.
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Players take turns rolling the dice and moving their respective tokens.

## ✨ Features

- **Dice Rolling Animation**: The dice roll is visually simulated, adding excitement to the game.
- **Snake and Ladder Graphics**: Representations of snakes and ladders are included to enhance gameplay.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token that moves across the board based on dice rolls.
- **Simple Controls**: Press the spacebar to roll the dice and move your token.
- **Win Condition**: The first player to reach the last square wins the game.
